      ELC is an essential tool used by schools within the USG school system
       for posting assignments, grades, lecture slides, and more. Often, students 
       and professors resort to external platforms such as Piazza, GroupMe, Tophat, Discord, 
       and Slack to utilize features and functionalities not available through eLC. Using these 
       external software, gives the professors limited control of the conversation, which may lead 
       to academic dishonesty among the students, general confusion amongst students, or some students
      missing out on the conversation.</p>
